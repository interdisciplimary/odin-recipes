        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Recently I learned how to cook a spaghetti squash. It was quite 
            a work out. Make sure your knife is sharp!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti Squash</li>
            <li>Oil, 2 teaspoons</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps for Spaghetti Squash</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
            <li>Slice the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and 
                scoop out the seeds and ribbing.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the inside of the squash with olive oil and 
                sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the spaghetti squash cut side down on the baking 
                sheet and use a fork to poke holes.</li>
            <li>Roast for 30 to 40 minutes or until lightly browned 
                on the outside, fork tender, but still a litte bit firm. 
                The time will vary depending on the size of your squash. 
                I also find that the timing can vary from squash to squash.
                Remove from the oven and flip the squash so that it’s cut 
                side up.</li>
            <li>When cool to the touch, use a fork to scrape and fluff 
                the strands from the sides of the squash.</li>

        </ol>
